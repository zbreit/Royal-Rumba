# Royal-Rumba
Arduino Sumo Robot Battle to the Death

We were inspired by sumo robotics competitions. Using the zumo library as our base, we made modifications to the example file in order to make the turning and movement algorithms more efficient.
We used:
#include <ZumoBuzzer.h>
#include <ZumoMotors.h>
#include <Pushbutton.h>
#include <QTRSensors.h>
#include <ZumoReflectanceSensorArray.h>
all from the https://github.com/pololu/zumo-shield github. We used the BorderDetect example as the base for our project.
